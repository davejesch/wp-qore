== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you see this plugin differentiating itself from others like Better WP Security, Hide My Login, or W3TC?  =

I can't say this plugin compares with the others. It wasn't created to compete with others. Truthfully, this plugin was created for myself. The functionality the plugin provides I use often with my own and even client sites. So I basically created a lightweight plugin that would serve the purpose of a way to turn on and off certain functionality preferably security and performance related things.

= Do you have a Github repository, too? =

Yes. I currently have WP Qore on Github. You may find the project here: https://github.com/icryptic/wp-qore
