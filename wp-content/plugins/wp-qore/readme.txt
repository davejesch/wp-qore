WordPress Security, Developer Tools Plugin.

== Description ==

<a target="_blank" href="http://wpqore.com/">WP Qore</a>, a plugin that provides additional security, performance functionality, and developer tools that can be turned on or off at any time. 

WP Qore offers many powerful features such as Security Advisor, which is our malware and anti-virus scanner. Protection for your WordPress website. Backed by updates from Google's database of web misfits. Rest assured you're always up-to-date and secured.

Another powerful feature WP QORE offers in Cache Assistance. Cache Assistance is the fastest, simpliest cache system for WordPress... peroid! Cache Assistance is the same as my WP-Cache.com plugin. So you if you have WP QORE activated, then you do-not need to have WP-CACHE.COM enabled or any other cache plugin.

WP Qore, first debut in the WordPress.org plugin repository is v1.1.4 and previous versions are maintained on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/icryptic/wp-qore/">Github</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you see this plugin differentiating itself from others like Better WP Security, Hide My Login, or W3TC?  =

I can't say this plugin compares with the others. It wasn't created to compete with others. Truthfully, this plugin was created for myself. The functionality the plugin provides I use often with my own and even client sites. So I basically created a lightweight plugin that would serve the purpose of a way to turn on and off certain functionality preferably security and performance related things.

= Do you have a Github repository, too? =

Yes. I currently have WP Qore on Github. You may find the project here: https://github.com/icryptic/wp-qore
